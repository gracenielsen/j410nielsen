  <div class="text"><strong>Saturday, October 12th, 2019, 2:07pm.</strong> “I always like to start at the shirts and work my way around,” said Mia, “One of my secrets is to always look in the men’s section, it always has cool t-shirts and jackets.” Getting creative and seeing potential in pieces are important when thrifting clothes. </div>

  <div class="text"><strong>Saturday, October 12th, 2019, 2:26pm.</strong> “I like to shop at Goodwill, Mission Thrift, and a few places in Morro Bay. It’s always fun to take part of the day to find some cool clothes or even other interesting things,”said Mia. Morro Bay boasts over 10 thrift stores and San Luis Obispo is home to around 12.

  <div class="text"><strong>Saturday, October 12th, 2019.</strong>Mia twists and turns in a bright yellow floral dress. “If I can’t see myself wearing something five times or more, I’ll put it back,” Mia said about her habit of impulse buying. Most items of clothing at Goodwill are under $15. </div>

  <div class="text"><strong>Saturday, October 12th, 2019.</strong> “Thrifting is one of the things that directly makes me feel like I’m lowering my impact on the environment. It bothers me that top brands for my demographic like H and Forever 21 don’t pay their workers a livable wage. So I consider it to be a hobby of mine that is low cost to me and the environment,” said Lucy Swift (not pictured), a fifth-year kinesiology major. </div>

Once, I had some kids come in who had to buy an entire outfit for $15 and then pin the receipt on their shirt to prove it and get into the party,” said Annette (right), a Goodwill employee.
